 Airline-Data-Analysis-Using-Qlik

 The project "Exploring Insights from Synthetic Airline Data Analysis with Qlik" involves utilizing synthetic airline data to derive valuable insights using Qlik, a business intelligence and data visualization tool. This project uses synthetic airline data to simulate flight schedules, passenger demographics, ticket sales, and performance metrics. The goal is to leverage Qlik's analytical tools to find patterns, trends, and correlations to aid decision-making for airlines and airports.

Scenario 1: Revenue Optimization An airline wants to boost revenue by analyzing historical ticket sales to identify peak travel times, popular destinations, and effective pricing strategies. Using Qlik, they can visualize revenue trends, segment customers by buying behavior, and adjust prices to maximize profits.

Scenario 2: Operational Efficiency An airport authority aims to enhance efficiency by analyzing flight schedules, passenger flows, and luggage handling. Integrating synthetic data with Qlik helps identify bottlenecks, predict peak traffic periods, and allocate resources to streamline operations.

Scenario 3: Customer Experience Enhancement Airlines seek to improve passenger experience by understanding customer preferences and satisfaction. Using sentiment analysis on feedback data in Qlik, they can identify improvement areas, personalize services, and tailor marketing to better meet customer needs, fostering loyalty and satisfaction.
